# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refren the previous guide,

 Listing products with React.js we created a simple list of the products we'd created in tc Dashboard. here we're going to look at how to display the contents of the cart and add those products to it. Finally, we'll add simulated recommended products to the cart to encourage further purchases.
 You can see the Demo in this for add to cart page https://addproducttocart.netlify.app

In this guide we'll:

Retrieve a cart from home and make it available to our app
Add React components to display the contents of the cart
Extend the existing products list to allow products to be added to the cart
Display simulated recommended products products in the cart
